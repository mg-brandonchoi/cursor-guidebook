# Cursor Guidebook Presentation Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is a single-page HTML presentation about "Cursor Chaos to Coding Zen" - a guide for developers on effectively using AI coding assistants. The project consists of:

- **Main file**: [index.html](mdc:index.html) - Complete presentation with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **Assets**: [assets/](mdc:assets) directory containing images and GIFs for visual elements

## Code Style Guidelines

### HTML Structure
- Use semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility
- Maintain consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Keep slide content within `.slide` containers
- Use meaningful class names that describe functionality, not appearance

### CSS Styling
- Follow BEM-like naming convention for CSS classes
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- Maintain the established color palette:
  - Primary: `#004D40` (Dark Teal)
  - Secondary: `#00796B` (Medium Teal) 
  - Background: `#F4F7F6` (Light Gray)
  - Accent: `#E0F2F1` (Light Teal)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Use flexbox and CSS Grid for layouts
- Implement proper breakpoints:
  - Small screens: `max-width: 768px`
  - Short screens: `max-height: 650px` and `max-height: 800px`

### JavaScript
- Use vanilla JavaScript for simplicity
- Implement keyboard navigation (arrow keys, spacebar)
- Maintain accessibility with proper button states

## Content Guidelines

### Slide Structure
- Each slide should have a clear hierarchy: h1 → h2 → h3 → content
- Use consistent spacing and margins
- Include slide numbers in footer (format: "X / Y")

### Visual Elements
- Use placeholder images with descriptive alt text
- Maintain consistent icon usage (emoji or font icons)
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility

### Code Examples
- Use syntax highlighting with the established color scheme
- Keep code blocks concise and focused
- Include proper error highlighting for comparison examples

## Development Workflow

### When Making Changes
1. Test responsiveness across different screen sizes
2. Verify keyboard navigation functionality
3. Check color contrast and accessibility
4. Validate HTML structure
5. Test slide transitions and animations

### Asset Management
- Store all images in [assets/](mdc:assets) directory
- Use descriptive filenames for assets
- Optimize images for web delivery
- Provide fallback content for missing images

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### When Working with This Project
- Focus on maintaining the established design system
- Preserve the presentation's educational flow and structure
- Keep accessibility in mind for all modifications
- Test changes across different viewport sizes
- Maintain the professional, developer-focused tone

### Common Tasks
- **Layout adjustments**: Always consider both desktop and mobile views
- **Content updates**: Maintain the slide's educational progression
- **Styling changes**: Use existing CSS variables and follow the color scheme
- **New features**: Ensure they work with keyboard navigation
